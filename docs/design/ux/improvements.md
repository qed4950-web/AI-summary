# Installer & Workcenter UX Polish (Draft)

## Installer Wizard
- [ ] Add policy configuration step (choose meeting/photo agents)
- [ ] Highlight default storage/offloading options
- [ ] Provide KPI opt-in toggle for telemetry collection

## Workcenter Dashboard
- [ ] Surface meeting/photo pipeline status and latest actions
- [ ] Display policy scope indicators for current session
- [ ] Quick links to audit logs and release checklist

## Notes
- Integrate KPI snapshot summaries from `scripts/util/release_prepare.py`
- Provide quick win Electron prototypes (see `ui/electron/`) for floating toolbars and desktop overlays.
- Coordinate with Cycle 3/4 agents to show actionable items
